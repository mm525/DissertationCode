# Public Dissertation Code

This repository contains code that I have used for sections of my dissertation.

Current sections:
- ARMA modelling of bond returns: OOP that enables user to create objects (based on securities) and plot a graph of their returns, carry out Augmented Dickey Fuller tests, plot correlograms to identify AR and MA processes, select an ARMA model and evaluate the best ARMA model subject to specified maximum AR and MA values.
